# Python3-project-re-assessment-data
This is a project I created for my intro to Python class using real estate assessment data from Fairfax County, VA that I acquired from data.gov.

The datasets are too large to upload, so if you want to work with the code, you will need these .csv files:

https://catalog.data.gov/dataset/tax-administrations-real-estate-assessed-values
https://catalog.data.gov/dataset/tax-administrations-real-estate-legal-data
https://catalog.data.gov/dataset/tax-administrations-real-estate-property-owner-addresses
https://catalog.data.gov/dataset/tax-administrations-real-estate-parcels-data
https://catalog.data.gov/dataset/tax-administrations-real-estate-sales-data
